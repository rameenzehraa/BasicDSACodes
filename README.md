Basic DSA Roadmap in C++

Step 1: Pick a programming language (e.g. C++).  
Step 2: Learn Programming Fundamentals.  
Step 3: Learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
Step 4: Start with Basic Data Structures:  
   - Array  
   - LinkedList  
   - Stack  
   - Queue  

Step 5: Learn Sorting Algorithms:  
   - Bubble Sort  
   - Selection Sort  
   - Insertion Sort  
   - Merge Sort  
   - Quick Sort  
   - Heap Sort  

Step 6: Learn Searching Algorithms:  
   - Linear Search  
   - Binary Search  

Step 7: Learn Tree Data Structures:  
   - Binary Trees  
   - Binary Search Trees (BST)  
   - AVL Trees  

Step 8: Learn Tree Traversals:  
   - Preorder Traversal  
   - Inorder Traversal  
   - Postorder Traversal  

Step 9: Learn Tree Search Algorithms:  
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)
